= Six Jewels for Sister Java

Code examples for "Six Jewels for Sister Java" a.k.a. "Six Gems",
presented at JChampionsConf 2025 and viewable on Youtube after.

This repo consists of half a dozen independant projects.
This was necessary because different recent versions of Java 
and/or --preview arguments are required for some of these examples.
